      Kohlberg’s theory of moral development outlines three basic levels of
      morality. I believe that I would be categorized in the third level,
      postconventional morality. This is because I have formed my own basic
      ethical principles and affirmed rights. I believe some rules can be broken
      if it aligns with my principles. A hypothetical example of this level is
      sharing a toy because you believe they have a right to play with it. The
      first level, preconventional morality, is simpler. It centers on
      self-interest where you obey to avoid punishment or to gain rewards. For
      example, sharing a toy to avoid being yelled at. The second level is
      conventional morality, which highlights upholding laws and social rules to
      maintain social order. An example would be sharing a toy to make everyone
      think you are a sharing person that follows rules. Kohlberg’s moral ladder
      nicely defines different ways of moral thinking.
