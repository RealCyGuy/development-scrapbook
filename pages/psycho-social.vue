      Erik Erikson outlines 8 distinct stages from birth to death in his theory
      of development. Stages 5 and 6, the issues of identity vs. role confusion
      and intimacy vs. isolation, may be the most difficult stages because of
      their impact on the rest of one's life. One of the main focuses of high
      school is working on cognitive development, but it is also a time when
      physical and social development are important. With all this happening,
      students are also expected to think about and plan their post-secondary
      activities.

      For me, my experiences out of school shaped my furture as much as my
      experiences in school did. Discovering programming and web development out
      of school during my early years of high school fueled my passion for
      technology that continues to this day. So when I didn't initially know
      what I wanted to do when choosing universities, I chose programs that were
      related to my interests.
