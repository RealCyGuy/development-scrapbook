      Something interesting was that my parents entered the hospital during good
      weather but exited the hospital to a snowstorm. This big surprise was an
      unexpected change for them. The room I was born in also happened to be the
      exact one my sister was born in two years later.

      I was five to six months when I learned to sit up. My first step was at
      around nine months. At two to three years old, I was officially potty
      trained.

      Here is a timeline I created of the average brain development from
      conception through age two:

      Puberty, in my own words, are the physical and emotional changes children
      go through as they mature into an adult. This key transition makes the
      body capable of reproduction.

      I am tasked to write a section for an upcoming Psychology textbook
      regarding the physical characteristics of adolescence and puberty. Here is
      my submission:

      Adolescence is the transitional phase of physical, emotional, and social
      development from childhood to adulthood. This transformation, known as
      puberty, is caused by hormones that trigger physical growth and
      psychological changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most significant changes are the ones involving primary and secondary
      sex characteristics. Primary sex characteristics are the external sex
      organs that distinguish males and females. The secondary characteristics
      are not essential for reproduction but contribute to distinguishing the
      sexes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surge of hormones released during puberty are powerful mood
      regulators. Teenagers may experience mood swings and feel overwhelmed by
      these new feelings. These developments can contribute to a higher
      likelihood of developing mood disorders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the drastic changes, social challenges may arise. Societal
      pressures and comparisons with peers may lead to body image concerns and
      insecurities. The increase in oil production leads to breakouts of acne
      and skin changes, adding to feelings of self-consciousness. Research
      suggests girls that develop faster tend to have lower self-esteem while
      earlier developing boys tend to have higher confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fascinating and crucial part of human development comes with many
      trials and tribulations. It is important to remember that these
      experiences are widely shared and normal.
