      My first word was “mama” which I said at 10 months. I think its due to the
      amount of time spent with my mom.

      <b>Telegraphic speech</b> is a very simple form of speech used by young
      children. The sentence they use omit many words, forming short sentences.
      The name comes from telegrams where compressed speech is often used to
      save money. <b>Overgeneralization</b> is expecting negative outcomes in
      all situations because of a previous negative experience.
      <b>Overextension</b> is using a single word to describe multiple objects
      or concepts. Because toddlers lack a lot of vocabulary, they only use
      words that they know to describe their surroundings.

      I am certain that I have used these forms of speech as a natural part of
      language development. However, neither my parents nor I have any specific
      memories of this.
