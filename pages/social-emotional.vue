      Harry Harlowâ€™s experiment revealed the importance of attachment at younger
      ages. In his experiment, he took infant monkeys away from their mothers
      and provided them with two surrogate mothers. One made of wire provided a
      food source, while the other was made of soft cloth. Surprisingly, the
      results of the experiment showed that the infant preferred the soft mother
      most of the time, highlighting the impact of the physical contact and
      emotional security.

      As a child, I was most attached to my younger sister. Our two year age
      difference may be a great contributor to our close relationship. We would
      regularly play and sing together.

      Imprinting is the phenomenon where animals form a strong bond with the
      first animal they see after being born. This theory supports the
      attachment with my sister as we both met each other when we were very
      young.

      An object I have formed attachments with is the small, striped white and
      blue blanket I had as a child. It was small but provided comfort with its
      soft and warm texture.

      The lack of attachment during early childhood can lead to insecure
      attachment, a lack of trust and secure base. This tends to cause reduced
      social and communication skills, which may persist into adulthood.
