      These are my favourite toys from each stage of Piagetâ€™s cognitive
      development:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sensorimotor</b> (0-2 years): My favourite toy was a soft dragonfly toy
      that had a string that would vibrate the toy when pulled. Its wings were
      made of a material containing a crinkly plastic that made noise. The toy's
      bright colours and sensory features were very appealing at this stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Preoperational</b> (2-6 years): According to my mother, I enjoyed
      playing with our white Nintendo DS Lite. I would frequently tap the screen
      with the included stylus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Concrete Operational</b> (7-11 years): Playing chess with my friends
      and family was a game I enjoyed at this stage. I would play with my friend
      often when I visited his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Formal Operational</b> (12+ years): At this stage, I began to be
      fascinated by computers. It is my favourite "toy" with its huge range of
      capabilities and games. When I discovered programming, my interest grew
      even more. Over the past few years, I have spent countless hours building
      programs, bots, and websites (like this one).
